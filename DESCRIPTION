Description: A data-driven test for the assumptions of
    quantile normalization using raw data such as objects
    that inherit eSets (e.g. ExpressionSet, MethylSet).
    Group level information about each sample (such as
    Tumor / Normal status) must also be provided because
    the test assesses if there are global differences in
    the distributions between the user-defined groups.
